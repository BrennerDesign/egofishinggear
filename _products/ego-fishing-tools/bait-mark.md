  <p>The EGO bait mark bait containment system is a revolutionary product that
  allows an angler to preserve live bait at the dock and then while fishing off
  shore. The bait mark can be easily collapsed for stowing and transport and
  then quickly deployed and tethered to the side of the boat with your live bait
  held inside. When collapsed the bait mark with its center float design can
  also be used as an offshore Marking device.</p>
