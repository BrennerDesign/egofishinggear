  <p>Looking for a tool to help retrieve your favorite fishing lures? &nbsp;We
  have designed a tool to help you with that. Just detach your net hoop from
  your S1 Genesis or S2 Slider landing net and screw on the EGO Lure Retriever.
  &nbsp;Most anglers say they can replenish their tackle box in two or three
  fishing trips.</p><h2>Two Ways to use the EGO Lure
  Retriever:</h2><ol><li>&nbsp;For snagged lures still attached to your line
  simply feed your line through the cutout in the center of the tool. &nbsp;Push
  the tool down your line till you reach your lure. Once you have reached your
  lure, wrap the chains around your lure's hooks. Once the chains are secured,
  pull up and retrieve your favorite lure.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;If you see
  a lure in the water that can be retrieved simply wrap the chains of the lure
  retriever around the hooks and retrieve the lure.&nbsp;</li></ol>
