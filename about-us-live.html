        <p>Fourteen years ago we set out on a simple mission -- to develop a better fishing landing net solution that addressed the many functional and performance problems that existed with the traditional products. What started out as a small landing net company has now grown into the innovation leader in the fishing net and accessories category of the Sport Fishing industry. </p>
        <p>The EGO S1 Genesis and EGO S2 Slider landing net series have been the flagship products under the EGO brand. However, in recent years the addition of the EGO fishing tools and accessories designed to meet specific angler applications and requirements have become and increasingly important aspect of the business.</p>
        <p>In 2016 the EGO Kryptek product series was launched featuring the high-tech and very popular Kryptek camo technology. The life style oriented product line brought a new standard in finish quality and design to the fishing net and accessories market and has rapidly gained popularity with anglers throughout the country.</p>

        <p>EGO products are sold in most major sporting goods retail chains and are carried by a large network of distributors and independent dealers in the United States. Distribution has also grown internationally to include countries such as Canada, Russia, South Africa, South Korea and Japan.</p>
        <p>From one simple mission has come a host of innovative fishing products that have elevated the fishing experience for thousands savvy anglers throughout the world.</p>
